# K8s the practical (?) way: KOPS

Goal is create a K8s cluster with the following:

- Own key provided
- Using a domain of mine
- Private zone, bastion


## Automagically
### Create the Cluster
run ./create_kops-cluster.sh

### Delete the Cluster
run ./delete_kops-cluster.sh

## Manually

### Run the "bare minimum" cluster creation

### Change to use your own domain
### Add a private zone
### Add a bastion
### Change to use your key
