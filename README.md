# k8s-the-harder-way-on-aws
Based on https://github.com/rmenn/kubernetes-the-hard-way-aws, which is also based on
https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way but in AWS

## Prerequisites and Conventions
- You have access to an AWS account. In my case on the us-west-2 region (cheapest, really)
- You have  enough rights. In my case, that meant IAM user with admin right, and a key/secret setup on .aws/credentials
-- In my case, I am calling the profile test-k8s, no wonder you'll see this often in my commands
- You have awscli setup. In my case 'pip install awscli --upgrade --user' did the trick

## Cloud provisioning
Based on https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/docs/01-infrastructure-gcp.md

aws --profile
